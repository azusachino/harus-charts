# AI Agents

This repository is designed to be maintained and developed by AI agents in collaboration with human developers.

- **Context Awareness**: All agents should refer to `GEMINI.md` for project overview, development workflows, and directory structures.
- **Task Management**: Use the CLI ticket system `tk` for tracking tasks and progress. Run `tk help` for more information.
- **Collaboration**: When multiple agents are active, ensure that changes are atomic, well-documented, and adhere to the established project conventions (CDK8s, Helm, etc.).
- **Consistency**: Maintain the style and architectural patterns found in the existing codebase.
